# On (Normalised) Discounted Cumulative Gain as an Off-Policy Evaluation Metric for Top-n Recommendation
Source code for experiments highlighting that normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) and DCG can lead to conflicting conclusions in offline experiments for top-n recommendation scenarios.

This repository accompanies [a preprint you can find on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15053).

The code makes use of [RecPack](https://recpack.froomle.ai/index.html), which needs to be installed before running the notebook.
You can find more information about it [in this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3523227.3551472).
